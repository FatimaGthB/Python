# Python

10/ Add elements to a dictionary: employes = {} list = [10, 2329, 5, "Pierre", 203, "Marie", 867, "Adrien"]

In this exercise, you need to loop through the list and add to the employ√© dictionary only those elements of the list that are strings.

The aim of the exercise is to sort the data and build an employee dictionary.

The dictionary keys must be id-xx, xx being the employee number.

Your script should therefore return the following dictionary in the variable employes :

{"id-01": "Pierre", "id-02": "Marie", "id-03": "Adrien"}
