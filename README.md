# Python

10/ Add elements to a dictionary: employes = {} list = [10, 2329, 5, "Pierre", 203, "Marie", 867, "Adrien"]

In this exercise, you need to loop through the list and add to the employÃ© dictionary only those elements of the list that are strings.

The aim of the exercise is to sort the data and build an employee dictionary.

The dictionary keys must be id-xx, xx being the employee number.

Your script should therefore return the following dictionary in the variable employes :

{"id-01": "Pierre", "id-02": "Marie", "id-03": "Adrien"}

11/ In this exercise, you need to retrieve different pieces from a list.

The starting list is as follows:

liste = ["Maxime", "Martine", "Christopher", "Carlos", "Michael", "Eric"]

The aim of this exercise is to retrieve the following information using slices:

The first three employees ("Maxime", "Martine" and "Christopher") in a three_firsts list.
The last three employees ("Carlos", "Michael" and "Eric") in a three_last list.

12/ In this exercise, you need to translate the following mathematical function f(x) = 7x + 14 (affine function) into a Python function that returns the result of the affine function for any x (integer). The Python function is called function_affine, and all you need to do is complete the following code : def fonction_affine(x: int) -> int:
